1. Adaptive Boosting (AB)                                                 2. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) 3. Support Vector Machines (SVM) 4. Neural Networks (ANN) 5. Cluster Analysis with Hierarchical Clustering Model.                                                • Learn the dimension-reduction technique, i.e., principle component analysis, to help decision-makers reduce the model complexity which makes them easier to understand the model abstraction.                                                  • Learn how to evaluate the models using, Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, and statistical performance indicators, and then to select the optimal model among all the available candidates for our future decision-making use.                                                 • Use the Rattle tool and its packages to apply the models and/or algorithms to solve the real-world decision-making problems.                                                 • Be able to complete a data-driven decision-making project.
